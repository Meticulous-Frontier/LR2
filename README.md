## How to Install:
1. Download the .zip files from the both of the repository links below.
2. Please note that zip-files cannot be extracted directly, but need some manual labor, since they are packaged zip files from their respective GIT repositories.
3. Extract the "Mods" folder of the lr2-mods.zip into the <Lab Rats 2/game/> folder.
4. You now should have a <Lab Rats 2/game/Mods> folder.
5. Extract "game" folder of the lab-rats2-v0.x.x-bf.zip into the the <Lab Rats 2> folder replacing the original game folder files with the bug-fix files.
6. Launch Lab Rats 2
7. Disable the animations in the preference screen, this original game feature is unstable and slow at best....
8. Start fresh game (when using bugfix, old saves from base game are no longer supported).
9. The MOD settings can be configured or en-/disabled from your bedroom.
10 Done.
