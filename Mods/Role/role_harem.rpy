# Harem Role - girl is accepted into the harem and accepts that she is not the only love interest
# - requires Threesome and love higher than 80
# Things to Consider:
# - can make a harem, lovable, or slavable? currently its lovable as per default and most easiest to implement
# - knows of the others in your harem
# - can have girlfriend and affair roles - when suggested, they may become soley harem, or need to be slowly intergrated
# - girlfriend roles - suggestion to complete, may take time to accept.
# - if affair role - similar to gf role, if they leave SO = harem, continues affair as harem but for the children
# - Harem_Mansion - eventually a place where they all can live together?
# - Dialogs can be done way better than the way I did them XD

# I tried, but it shifted around too much, not familiar with the boxes in python
#
# THIS ALLOWS tracking the girlfriend/paramour/poly/tranced/aroused/babymomma around on the map
# Allows to add girlfriend/paramour to polyamorous relationship.
# MUST BE 80+ love, and likes threesomes >0 minimum.
# Must be either GF/Paramour to unlock Polyamory
# if Paramour joins Polyamory, they still are with their BF/husbands and can still leave them and join the poly.
# - this will open up a whole bunch of extra events we can add
