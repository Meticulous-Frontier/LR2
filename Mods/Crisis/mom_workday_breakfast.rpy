## Morning crisis
#Have breakfast with Jennifer. Designed as an opportunity to raise her obedience, and to give some variation to morning events
#You wake up and have breakfast with Jennifer. At minimal sluttiness, gives MC the option to giver her a motivational speech.
#At mid sluttiness, MC can tell Jennifer she should try going to work without underwear on, try and get attention from men that way.
#At high sluttiness, Jennifer asks MC to cum on/in her so she can feel it throughout the day.
#Fetish options: for Anal, Jennifer asks for anal, for cum fetish, you cum on/in her as appropriate, and for vaginal, she asks for creampie.
