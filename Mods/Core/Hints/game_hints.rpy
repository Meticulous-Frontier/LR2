# The hint system is designed, so it does not need to be stored in a save game.
# Because it is not stored, we can update the list (or fix an issue) without breaking existing save games.
# A hint has a start condition and a completion condition.
# Only when the start condition evaluates to True and the completion condition evaluates to False it will be shown to the user.
