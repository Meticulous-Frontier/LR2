#This scene is for Kaya and Erica tuesday night study sessions at the university.
#Currently this scene should roughly mimic study session progress of the study sessions with the tutor
#STAGES:
#0: Just help them study
#1: but only if they strip for each wrong answer
#2: they get spanked for each wrong answer
#3: they suck you off for each wrong answer
#4: girl with most right answer gets fucked, while the loser gets eaten out.

#All stages should present opportunity to build sluttiness a bit.
