#   Third event: You offer to let her stay in exchange for "favors". She agrees.
#   Even requirements: Charisma and marketing skill combined.
#   Girl requirements: Since she is a subclass, will have to generate at run time.
#   Other notes: Make random event after third event, whenever she is in town she may ask to come over and spend the night.
#   After stage 6, girl will change to 7 if she is coming over, then back to 6 in the morning.
#
#   Event States:
