#************* Casual Sex Role: College Athlete  *******************
#Outline
#-College Athlete
# Looking for casual sex while she focuses on her school and athletic program
# Tends to hang out at the Gym
#  First event: She invites you to work out with her. You work up a sweat together, then sneak into a changing room for sex
#  Second event: She invites you to compete with her in distance race (10k? something similar). Makes a wager if you win she'll let you "do what you want" with her
#  Event Requirements: Advances with sluttiness and player energy. Max energy takes the place of physical fitness during this storyline
#  Girl requirements: Age <25, skinny body type.
#  Other notes: She calls it off if she "catches feels" (love > 50). Will start warning player at > 40 love
