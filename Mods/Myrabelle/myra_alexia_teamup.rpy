#Myra and Alexia teamup scene! Myra invites Alexia over for a game night.
#Happens on Friday nights because that's the only night that makes actual logical sense to have an all night gaming session
#Unfortunately this conflicts with dates so probably lots of QQ
#Oh well. Progression is similar to Myra's focus practice.
#Mc shows up to game night, but girls are playing a two player only game.
#Girls wager that winner gets a back rub. MC agrees. Myra wins, but they agree to make it a weekly thing and invite MC back anytime
#During recurrent, reward progression goes to...
#Back rub - fingering - oral servicing - Full service - Free Use
#

# 16/25
