# Myrabella is our generic gamer girl archetype. Blue hair, attitude, etc.
# Friends with Alexia from the start, she is opening a gaming cafe and is trying to make money in esports
# Her love story will be her primary story, revolves around her trying to establish an esports brand and make a name for herself
# Timeline involves working to get better, her first tournament (and failure), MC offering to sponsor her, 2nd attempt (success), finally business expansion
# Sluttiness story is a corruption of each step as we go along. When helping her to get better, train her focus while she is playing by fondling her.
# After sponsoring her, MC can add his own serum formular to the drink machines at the gaming cafe, allowing for corruption of the general public.
# When she reveals she didn't get a sponsorship the first time, can tell her she should get bigger tits.
# Myra's bar date opens up the option to play arcade game
#
# Teamup option is Alexia. On friday nights, they start to have all night gaming sessions. At first, MC just plays games with them, but it transitions to massages...
# ... topless massages, fingering, eventually at full corruption start the night with them naked and MC has total free-use while they play video games.
