# This file contains the details of Myra's focus training scenes.
# This scene will be callable on demand via Myra's role.
# Starts off with basic back massage while she is playing games. Progression:
# Back rub > Grope > Sit on lap with fingering > Assjob > Anal
# Each scene progresses based on sluttiness AND on Myra's focus level.
# Focus has increased chance of increasing based on suggestability.
# If Myra is in trance, give MC a chance to raise Focus at the end of the scene if it is below MC's value for free.
#7/13
