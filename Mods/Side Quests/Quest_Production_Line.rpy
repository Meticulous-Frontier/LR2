#Super basic intro quest. Is available early, will help with early profitability if selected.
#Quest requires someone in production. STarts when girl approaches you, says father also works in pharmaceuticals. Sets you up to get coffee with him next day.
#next day if MC meets with father, says he is worried about daughter who is having money problems.
#Says if you give her a pay raise without telling her he told you to do it, he will share company secrets that will increase your chemical production.
#MC agrees. IF you give her a raise within 10 days, he meets with you again and agrees to help you. Meet for coffee again and gain an upgrade to serum production (+1)
#If you don't, he texts you and says he is disappointed. Says he is going to try and convince her to leave.
#Immediate happiness drop and penalties to happiness, such that girl probably quits
