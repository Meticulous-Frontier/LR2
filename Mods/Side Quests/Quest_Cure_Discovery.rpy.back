#Anytime game quest. Available immediately, requires lab leader and at least 1 person in marketing. Gains potency as the game progresses.
#MC and science leader discover cure for some disease.
#At low tier research, discover cure for some obscure disease
#Higher tiers, discover cure for high profile diseases.
#MC realizes he is not equipped to handle production of the drug. Work with marketing to sell patent rights.
#Patent rights sold gives extra cash based on what disease was cured. Should be significant but not OP sum.

# flags
# 1: Quest has been initiated
# 9: If at any point during the quest we fire the head researched. (BAD END)
# 11: Science leader contacts MC, informs him that she stumbled on cure for disease. X
# 18: MC decides to try and keep them all for himself to manufacture small scale.
# 19: MC discovers girl secretly donated drug to large pharma company. (BAD END)
# 21: MC decides to try and sell patent for the drug. Decides to work with someone from marketing.
# 29: After 7 days, if MC hasn't initiated sale with marketing, MC discovers large PHARMA company just announced cure. His cure is worthless (BAD END)
# 31: Talked to marketing about trying to sell patent rights.
# 101: A few days later, marketing returns and gives MC details on selling the patent rights. Payout!
