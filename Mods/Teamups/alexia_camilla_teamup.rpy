#Camilla Teamups.

#planned teamups: Alexia is her main teamup. Starts with taking boudoir photos for her hubby, can end up taking them for MC
#If MC corrupts Camilla AND Alexia, have the option to have them both leave their SOs for MC at the same time.
#Alexia explores hotwifey lifestyle during team up. MC and encourage or discourage it.

#Boudoir photo stages:
# 1 - Sexy photos of both girls, Camilla talks a bit about hotwife lifestyle if alexia is dating
# 2 - Sexy photos. Ends with Camilla taking deepthroat, alexia disbelief she would "cheat". Give MC option to encourage hotwifing or encourage alexia to keep it secret.
# 3 - transition to 3 is decision time. Alexia gets turned on and blows MC. MC can start exerting pressure on her (you're mine while you're here) or encourage sharing
# 4 - Full on threesome. If MC exerting, girls talk about enjoying their MC time. If hotwifing, girls talk about getting reclaimed.
# 5 - Exerting - Convince girls to dump their SOs, commit to you. If hotwifing, option to have SOs watch the photo shoot.
