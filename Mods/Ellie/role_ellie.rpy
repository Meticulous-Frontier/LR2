#Ellie's story is a coming of age story (even though she's 24) because she grew up in a strict religious family.
#Ellie has ZERO experience, and therefore ZERO sex opinions.
#During her story, MC will have choices in her initial sexual encounters. MC choices will shape her opinions
#E.G., if you make her fingering scene good, she loves getting fingered. If you degrade her during, she hates it.
#Good ending to scenes should be available to 90% of players based on stats. don't make them too restrictive.
#GOOD OPTIONS ALWAYS OPEN WITH LOVE. She is supposed to be your souther belle sweetheart.
#All sexual options are opened during story. EG she is completely frigid until players progress with her.
#Progressing with Ellie may also open up new nanobot improvements.
#Uses the date override code from the old casual sex code to modify her dates so MC can't go back to her place until appropriate point in the story.
