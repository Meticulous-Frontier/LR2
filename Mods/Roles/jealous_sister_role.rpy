# This is a hidden role designed to track changes in jealousy status in the sister pair Ashley and Stephanie
# In general, sexual actions performed with the non jeaouls girl increases jealousy score in the jealous sister
# when scores get high enough, jealous sister may approach MC looking for sex or force satisfaction.
# Possibly add an option to convince a girl to stop being so jealous

############ Jealous sister implemenation ###############
# NOTE: Please read notes before modifying code.
# Jealous score is affected by and changed by witnessing or infering sexual encounters with the person she is jealous of.
# When jealous person sees or infers a sexual act, add a tuple to the list that contains a description of the act and the type of the act.
# Act description is called when jealous person tells you they know about doing XYZ with person.
# type of act is used so jealous person knows what they need in order to be given the same or similar treatment, EG: you fucked her, fuck me, she blew you, now eat me, etc.
# When a jealous person is made whole and is no longer jealous, reset the list
# Make sure all jealous acts can be run on people EVEN WITHOUT THE ROLE and exits appropriately because we may not always be able to test and see if someone should be jealous.
