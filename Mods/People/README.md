Creating a new custom character requires all 3 rpy files in the `Mods/People/Template/` folder.
Suggested method for making a new character:

1- Create a new folder in the `Mods/People/` folder, IE `Mods/People/Charissa/`
2- Copy paste the three files from this folder to that folder
3- Search for and replace TEMPLATE with your new character's name in all the new files.
4- Modify personality as needed for your character. NOTE: Not all labels have to be written! You can cherry pick appropriate ones and set a default-prefix to use existing personalities.
5- Add you character's story to the _role file. For examples, see modded girls and their stories, IE Sarah
